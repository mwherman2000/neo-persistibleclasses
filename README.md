## What is NPC?

* NEO Persistable Classes
* Long name: NEO Persistable Class (NPC) Framework 1.0
* Byline: An Efficient Object-Oriented Framework for C#.NEO Smart Contract Development 

## What is NPCdApp 1.0?

NPCdApp 1.0 is a C#.NEO smart contract dApp built for the CoZ dApp Competition #2 (closing date: February 24, 2018) to demonstrate NPC’s:
* Unique object-oriented programming style for C#.NEO smart contract development 
* Layered entity persistence model
